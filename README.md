# Tadabbr

**Tadabbr** is a web application that allows users to explore and search Arabic poetry cited in classical Quranic tafsir (exegesis). It provides a clean and intuitive interface to discover how early scholars used poetry to explain and contextualize Quranic verses.

## Features

- 🔍 **Search by keyword, poet name, or Quranic verse**
- 📖 **Browse poems linked to specific Surahs and Ayahs**
- 🧩 **View poetic citations in their original tafsir context**
- 🗃️ **Backed by a structured database of verse-linked poetry**

## Purpose

Classical Islamic scholars often used pre-Islamic and early Islamic poetry to clarify linguistic meanings and rhetorical structures in the Quran. **Tadabbr** makes these references searchable and accessible, helping researchers, students, and enthusiasts explore the rich interplay between Quranic interpretation and Arabic poetic tradition.

## Data Source
